<p>In my own life, I have at times felt a sense of incompleteness, aching for a sense of place in this world, and a melancholy that perhaps it no longer exists. The Portuguese call this saudade, the Germans sehnsucht. Meaningfully, there is no word for this in my native English. And while I feel unanchored and adrift, in my paintings I can be anywhere. Water is never the same, and each time I add pigment to the wax or heat the painting, it becomes a different place. Each work is infinite in possibility and it is only in letting go</p>
